# Pavement_crack_detection
Created as part of the Machine Learning and Scientific Computing course Compared the performance of four models: ResNet-18, UNet++, ViT-V16, and MobileNet Contributed to the implementation and tuning of CNN-based models, particularly ResNet-18 Focused on model training, evaluation, and performance analysis for crack detection tasks.
